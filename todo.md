# Coverage Action Development Plan

## Objectives

- [ ] Create a GitHub Action to analyze code coverage in Pull Requests
- [ ] Provide clear coverage metrics in PR comments
- [ ] Set up configurable coverage thresholds

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Action Setup

- [ ] Create action.yml configuration file
- [ ] Define required inputs and outputs
- [ ] Set up Docker container or JavaScript-based action
- [ ] Configure action permissions

### 2. Core Functionality

- [ ] Implement coverage report parsing
  - [ ] Support multiple coverage formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
  - [ ] Extract coverage metrics
- [ ] Add PR comment functionality
  - [ ] Design comment template
  - [ ] Implement GitHub API integration
- [ ] Create coverage comparison logic
  - [ ] Compare against base branch
  - [ ] Calculate coverage differences

### 3. Configuration Options

- [ ] Minimum coverage threshold
- [ ] Coverage report file path
- [ ] Custom comment template
- [ ] Fail conditions configuration

### 4. Testing

- [ ] Set up test environment
- [ ] Create sample coverage reports
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Test with different programming languages

### 5. Documentation

- [ ] Update README.md with:
  - [ ] Installation instructions
  - [ ] Configuration options
  - [ ] Usage examples
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines
- [ ] Create changelog

### 6. CI/CD

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for the action itself
- [ ] Create release automation
- [ ] Add version tagging

## Nice to Have

- [ ] Support for multiple coverage report formats
- [ ] Coverage trend visualization
- [ ] Detailed coverage breakdown by file
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications
- [ ] Coverage badge generation
